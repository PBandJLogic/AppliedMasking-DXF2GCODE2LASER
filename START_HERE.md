# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

## Choose Your Path

### ü™ü Windows Users

**The executables in this repository won't work on Windows** (they're built for Mac).

**Pick one:**

1. **üì¶ Build Windows executables** (takes 15-20 min)
   - Follow: [WINDOWS_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md](WINDOWS_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
   - Best if you have Windows PC

2. **ü§ñ Use automated builds** (easiest, no Windows needed)
   - Follow: [GITHUB_ACTIONS_BUILD.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_BUILD.md)
   - Set up once, get executables automatically

3. **üêç Run from Python** (if you have Python)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python dxf2laser.py
   ```

4. **üåê Use web version** (any browser)
   - Follow: [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

### üçé macOS Users (You're Ready!)

**Your executables are already built! Just run them:**

```bash
cd dist/
./DXF2Laser
# or
./GCodeAdjuster
```

Or double-click the files in Finder.

### üêß Linux Users

Same as Windows - you need to build on Linux or run from source.
